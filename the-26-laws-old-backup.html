                    <p>Before you can heal, you need to know what you're working with. This season establishes the neurobiological and attachment blueprints that formed under duress. We confront the invisible forces: inherited survival strategies, the mechanics of trauma bonding, and the critical distinction between a psychological flaw and a physiological adaptation. Healing starts not with fixing yourself, but with <strong>understanding your original, brilliant wiring</strong>.</p>

Your nervous system is constantly scanning the environment for danger—a process Dr. Stephen Porges calls <em>neuroception</em>. This happens in the brainstem, far below conscious thought. If you grew up in a war zone (emotional or physical), your "threat dial" was permanently soldered to <strong>ON</strong> to keep you alive.</p>

Dr. Rachel Yehuda's work on Holocaust survivors shows that trauma can alter gene expression (epigenetics), resulting in a nervous system that is biologically primed for stress before you've experienced your own trauma.</p>

This is your brainstem's last-ditch survival protocol: shut down everything non-essential and wait for the threat to pass.</p>
