        <p>These laws survived five rewrites, three breakdowns, two near-deaths, and one full collapse of my life. They’re not theories. They’re <strong>field notes from the inside of trauma circuitry.</strong></p>

        <p>They’re organized into <strong>five seasons</strong> because healing happens in arcs, not steps. You don’t climb out—you cycle upward.</p>

        <p><strong>Start wherever you are. Return when you’re ready. There’s no wrong door here.</strong></p>

        <div class="season-header">
            <h2>Season 1: Foundations</h2>
            <p class="season-description">The origin story of your wiring. Before healing comes understanding. Before tools come truth.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- LAW 1 -->
        <div class="law-card" id="law-1">
            <div class="law-number">Law #1</div>
            <h3>Survival Is Wiring, Not Weakness</h3>
            <p class="law-tagline">You weren’t broken—you were calibrated for war.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">When trauma hits early, your nervous system reorganizes around threat. Hypervigilance, shutdown, anxiety—these aren’t flaws. They’re adaptations your biology made on your behalf.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- LAW 2 -->
        <div class="law-card" id="law-2">
            <div class="law-number">Law #2</div>
            <h3>Trauma Is Inherited, Not Just Experienced</h3>
            <p class="law-tagline">Your body remembers things you never lived.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">Epigenetics passes down survival patterns. Your parents' wounds become your nervous system’s foundation. The ghosts weren’t yours—but the consequences were.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- LAW 3 -->
        <div class="law-card" id="law-3">
            <div class="law-number">Law #3</div>
            <h3>A Dangerous Shelter Is Still a Shelter</h3>
            <p class="law-tagline">Love and fear wired together create dependency.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">Trauma bonds form when the same person provides safety and threat. Leaving feels like dying because your nervous system mistakes chaos for home.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- LAW 4 -->
        <div class="law-card" id="law-4">
            <div class="law-number">Law #4</div>
            <h3>Unprocessed Grief Becomes a Ghost</h3>
            <p class="law-tagline">What you avoid becomes what hunts you.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">Blocked grief mutates into rage, collapse, addiction, numbness. Pain doesn’t vanish—it waits.</p>

            <p class="law-tagline">If life’s on fire, at least the shift has rules.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">Work gives structure trauma never offered. Hypervigilance turns into competence. But the moment the engine stops, the demons catch up.</p>

            <p class="law-tagline">Shame fills the silence diagnosis should’ve filled.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">Trauma responses masquerade as character flaws until named. Language is liberation.</p>

            <p class="law-tagline">Your body mistakes chaos for chemistry.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">Calm feels foreign. Intensity feels like love. Your wiring confuses safety with boredom.</p>

            <p class="law-tagline">It starts with fireworks and ends with chains.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">Overwhelming affection early on is manipulation disguised as magic. It’s the bait before the trap.</p>

            <p class="law-tagline">Systems punish what they can’t translate.</p>
            <p class="law-summary">CPTSD behaviors read like defiance in systems built for compliance. The mismatch destroys lives.</p>
