            <p>These laws survived five complete rewrites of the memoir. They're not abstract theory—they're battle-tested against 43 years of lived wreckage.</p>
            <p>They're organized into <strong>five seasons of healing</strong>. You can't skip to integration if you haven't dealt with the wiring. Each season builds on the last.</p>

    <!-- SEASON 1: FOUNDATIONS -->
    <section class="laws-season">
        <div class="container">
            <div class="season-header">
                <h2>Season 1: Foundations</h2>
                <p class="season-description">Understanding the wiring, inherited trauma, and early survival mechanisms. Before you can heal, you need to know what you're working with.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-1">
                <div class="law-number">Law #1</div>
                <h3>Survival Is Wiring, Not Weakness</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">Born wired for war, not broken.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">When trauma begins at birth, it rewires the nervous system for constant threat detection. What looks like anxiety or overreaction is early wiring doing its job. You're not defective—you're adapted to impossible circumstances.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-2">
                <div class="law-number">Law #2</div>
                <h3>Trauma Is Inherited, Not Just Experienced</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You carried ghosts before you had a name for them.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Intergenerational trauma doesn't require firsthand experience. You inherit nervous system dysregulation, relational templates, and survival strategies from parents who were themselves traumatized. The wiring predates your conscious memory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-3">
                <div class="law-number">Law #3</div>
                <h3>A Dangerous Shelter Is Still a Shelter</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You stay because leaving feels like dying.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Trauma bonds form when safety and threat come from the same source. The nervous system learns to equate love with danger, stability with chaos. Leaving isn't a choice when your wiring says staying is survival.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-4">
                <div class="law-number">Law #4</div>
                <h3>Unprocessed Grief Becomes a Ghost</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">What you don't mourn will haunt you.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Grief that isn't processed doesn't disappear—it lingers as rage, depression, dissociation, addiction. When you can't grieve safely, the loss follows you into every relationship, every choice, every moment of quiet.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- SEASON 2: BATTLEFIELDS -->

            <div class="season-header">
                <h2>Season 2: Battlefields</h2>
                <p class="season-description">How trauma wiring shows up in work, relationships, and family patterns. The external manifestations of internal architecture.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-5">
                <div class="law-number">Law #5</div>
                <h3>Work Becomes the War You Can Win</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">If you can't control your life, control the shift.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">When home is chaos, work becomes refuge. Hypervigilance that destroys relationships makes you exceptional at crisis management. You work to outrun your mind—but the second you stop, it catches up.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-6">
                <div class="law-number">Law #6</div>
                <h3>Mother Wounds Don't Die with Mothers</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">The absence echoes louder than presence ever did.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Maternal trauma—abandonment, neglect, enmeshment—shapes attachment for life. When the first relationship teaches you that love is conditional or dangerous, every connection after carries that blueprint.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-7">
                <div class="law-number">Law #7</div>
                <h3>Before You Have the Word for It, You Just Think You're the Asshole</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">Shame thrives where diagnosis is missing.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Trauma responses look like character flaws until you have the language to name them. Hypervigilance reads as paranoia. Emotional dysregulation reads as drama. Diagnosis doesn't excuse harm—it reframes it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-8">
                <div class="law-number">Law #8</div>
                <h3>You Can't Parent from an Empty Well</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">Drowning people can't teach swimming lessons.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">When you're dysregulated, you dysregulate your kids. When you're dissociated, you're emotionally absent. Parenting while drowning doesn't make you a bad parent—it makes you human. But it perpetuates the cycle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-9">
                <div class="law-number">Law #9</div>
                <h3>Dangerous Love Feels Like Home</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You mistake chaos for chemistry.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">When your nervous system is wired for danger, calm feels like waiting for the other shoe to drop. Drama, intensity, and volatility feel familiar—like love. Safe relationships feel boring, even threatening.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-10">
                <div class="law-number">Law #10</div>
                <h3>Love Bombing Isn't Love—It's a Down Payment on Control</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">They flood you so you'll drown for them.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Excessive affection, attention, and gifts in the early stages of a relationship aren't generosity—they're investment in future manipulation. The nervous system gets addicted to the intensity, making withdrawal devastating.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-11">
                <div class="law-number">Law #11</div>
                <h3>The Armor That Saved You Will Eventually Suffocate You</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">What protects you in war destroys you in peace.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Dissociation, hypervigilance, emotional shutdown—these adaptations kept you alive. But in safety, they prevent intimacy, joy, presence. The very mechanisms that saved you now keep you from living.</p>

            <div class="season-header">
                <h2>Season 3: Systems & Shadows</h2>
                <p class="season-description">Navigating institutions, internal hijackers, and the ways trauma shows up in your body. The collision with external systems and internal chaos.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-12">
                <div class="law-number">Law #12</div>
                <h3>The Courtroom Doesn't Speak Trauma</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">The system punishes what it doesn't understand.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Legal systems demand linear narratives, rational behavior, and compliance. Trauma produces fragmented memory, freeze responses, and avoidance. When institutions don't recognize CPTSD, survival mechanisms get criminalized.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-13">
                <div class="law-number">Law #13</div>
                <h3>When the System Fails You, You Learn to Fail the System</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You stop showing up because they never did.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Repeated institutional betrayal—courts, rehab, healthcare—teaches the nervous system that compliance is futile. Missed appointments, noncompliance, and avoidance aren't defiance. They're learned helplessness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-14">
                <div class="law-number">Law #14</div>
                <h3>Dissociation Is a Superpower Until It Becomes a Prison</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You survived by leaving your body. Now you can't get back in.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Dissociation lets you endure the unendurable. But chronic dissociation leaves you numb, detached, unable to feel pleasure or pain. You survived by disconnecting—now you can't reconnect.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-15">
                <div class="law-number">Law #15</div>
                <h3>Your Body Kept the Score When Your Mind Went Blank</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">Trauma lives in your nervous system, not just your memory.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">The body remembers what the mind forgets or dissociates. Chronic pain, autoimmune conditions, digestive issues, sleep disorders—these are somatic symptoms of unprocessed trauma. Healing requires addressing the body, not just the mind.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-16">
                <div class="law-number">Law #16</div>
                <h3>Addiction Is Regulation, Not Recreation</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You weren't getting high. You were getting quiet.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Substances, work, sex, food—addiction is self-medication for emotional dysregulation. When you don't have healthy coping mechanisms, you use what works. The problem isn't the substance. It's what you're trying to silence.</p>

                <h2>Season 4: Relapses & Reckonings</h2>
                <p class="season-description">Understanding healing spirals, boundaries, intimacy fears, and the nature of recovery. Progress isn't linear.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-17">
                <div class="law-number">Law #17</div>
                <h3>Healing Isn't Linear—It's a Spiral</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You revisit old wounds at new altitudes.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Relapse doesn't mean failure. Recovery means circling back to familiar pain with new tools, deeper insight, and better support. Each loop teaches something the last one couldn't. Progress is measured in spirals, not straight lines.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-18">
                <div class="law-number">Law #18</div>
                <h3>You Can't Trust a Hand on Your Back if You're Still Bracing for a Knife</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">Intimacy feels dangerous when your wiring says closeness kills.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">When every early relationship taught you that love comes with conditions or violence, vulnerability feels like exposure. Trust requires safety—and safety requires nervous system regulation before it requires a person.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-19">
                <div class="law-number">Law #19</div>
                <h3>No Is a Full Sentence—But Trauma Makes You Forget the Period</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You explain, justify, and apologize for boundaries you're allowed to set.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Fawn response turns boundaries into negotiations. You over-explain, soften, apologize—because saying "no" without justification once meant danger. Healthy boundaries feel aggressive when your wiring equates self-protection with selfishness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-20">
                <div class="law-number">Law #20</div>
                <h3>Relapse Teaches What Sobriety Can't</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You learn the shape of the fire by getting burned.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Relapse reveals unaddressed trauma, unmet needs, and dysfunctional coping. It's not moral failure—it's diagnostic information. What you were trying to silence is the thing that needs to be heard.</p>

                <h2>Season 5: Faith, Memory & Meaning</h2>
                <p class="season-description">Questioning God, finding solitude, understanding memory, practicing forgiveness, and learning to carry the fire. This is integration.</p>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-21">
                <div class="law-number">Law #21</div>
                <h3>If God Let This Happen, You're Allowed to Question Him</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">Faith that survives doubt is the only faith worth having.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Trauma survivors are told to trust God, have faith, believe it's all part of a plan. But when suffering is senseless, anger at God is more honest than empty platitudes. Doubt isn't the opposite of faith—it's the foundation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-22">
                <div class="law-number">Law #22</div>
                <h3>Isolation Is Punishment, But Solitude Is Sanctuary</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You learn the difference between being alone and being abandoned.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Isolation is enforced disconnection—shame, avoidance, rejection. Solitude is chosen quiet—space to process, heal, and breathe without performance. One kills you. The other saves you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-23">
                <div class="law-number">Law #23</div>
                <h3>Memory Is a Scar, Not a Story</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">It's not supposed to make sense. It's supposed to make you survive.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Trauma memory isn't linear or coherent. It's fragmented, somatic, implicit. Trying to force it into narrative creates false coherence. Memory exists to warn you, not to explain you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-24">
                <div class="law-number">Law #24</div>
                <h3>Forgiveness Is for You, Not for Them</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You don't forgive to absolve them. You forgive to release yourself.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Forgiveness doesn't require reconciliation, trust, or relationship. It's the decision to stop letting their actions control your nervous system. It's not about them deserving it. It's about you deserving peace.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-25">
                <div class="law-number">Law #25</div>
                <h3>Integration Means Carrying All of It</h3>
                <p class="law-tagline">You don't erase the past. You learn to hold it without being consumed.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">Healing isn't erasing trauma. It's integrating it into a coherent sense of self. The wiring doesn't disappear—it becomes part of your wisdom. You carry the fire without letting it burn you down.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="law-card" id="law-26">

                <p class="law-tagline">Live with your fire, don't burn down.</p>
                <p class="law-summary">The goal isn't to extinguish the trauma, but to learn to carry it with wisdom. You survived the inferno. Now learn to carry the flame. The fire that nearly killed you becomes the light you offer others.</p>
