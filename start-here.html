            <h2>What This Site Is</h2>
            <p>This is a clinical reference for understanding Complex PTSD. No coddling. No therapeutic language that says nothing. Just frameworks, terminology, and tools built from lived experience and backed by research.</p>
            <p>Everything here is drawn from the memoir <em>From the Storm to the Fire: 26 Laws of Survival</em>—a case study of what happens when you're wired for danger from birth and spend 43 years navigating the aftermath.</p>
            <p><strong>The site is the map. The book is the terrain.</strong></p>

                <p>This is the origin story. Thirty days in a NICU incubator in 1982—no mother's touch, just machines and alarms. The nervous system learned distance and danger before language existed. This blueprint explains why:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The world never felt safe</li>
                    <li>Hypervigilance became baseline</li>
                    <li>Sensory overload was constant</li>
                    <li>Connection felt dangerous</li>

                    <li><strong>Act III: Systems & Shadows</strong> — Courtrooms, institutions, internal hijackers</li>
                    <li><strong>Act IV: Relapses & Reckonings</strong> — Healing spirals, boundaries, addiction</li>
                    <li><strong>Act V: Faith, Memory & Meaning</strong> — Integration and carrying the fire</li>
                </ul>
