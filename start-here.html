        <h2>What This Site Is: Your Map to Healing</h2>
        <p>This resource is your non-clinical, trauma-informed map built from lived experience and backed by research. We cut through the complicated language to give you clear, actionable frameworks.</p>
        <p>Everything here is drawn from the memoir <em>From the Storm to the Fire: 26 Laws of Survival</em>—a 43-year case study detailing what happens when you’re wired for danger from birth and spend decades navigating the aftermath.</p>

                <h3>The Glass Box Blueprint</h3>
                <p>This is the origin story. Thirty days in a NICU incubator in 1982—no mother's touch, just machines and alarms. The nervous system learned distance and danger before language existed. This blueprint explains why:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The world never felt safe</li>
                    <li>Hypervigilance became baseline</li>
                    <li>Sensory overload was constant</li>
                    <li>Connection felt dangerous</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The 26 Laws of Survival</h3>
                <p>These laws survived five complete rewrites of the memoir. They're organized into 5 Acts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Act I: Foundations</strong> — Early wiring, inherited trauma, dangerous shelter</li>
                    <li><strong>Act II: Battlefields</strong> — Work, love, family patterns</li>
                    <li><strong>Act III: Systems & Shadows</strong> — Courtrooms, institutions, internal hijackers</li>
                    <li><strong>Act IV: Relapses & Reckonings</strong> — Healing spirals, boundaries, addiction</li>
                    <li><strong>Act V: Faith, Memory & Meaning</strong> — Integration and carrying the fire</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each law includes a clinical summary and practical takeaway.</p>
