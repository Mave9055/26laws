            <h2>The Book & The Site</h2>
            <p>This site is built on frameworks from the memoir <em>From the Storm to the Fire: 26 Laws of Survival</em>—a 43-year case study of what happens when you're wired for distance and danger from day one. The site provides the map, but the memoir provides the essential context to turn these concepts into survival strategies. Without the lived terrain, the map is just theory.</p>
