                    <p>This site is built on the frameworks from the memoir <em>From the Storm to the Fire: 26 Laws of Survival</em>—a 43-year case study of what happens when you're wired for distance and danger from day one.</p>
                    <p><strong>The book is the lived terrain.</strong> Childhood violence, twenty years of toxic marriage, addiction, manipulation, collapse, and the brutal work of understanding it all.</p>
                    <p><strong>The site is the clinical map.</strong> The Glass Box Blueprint, the 26 Laws, and every term here started as survival mechanisms before they became teaching tools.</p>
                    <p>You don't need the book to use the site. But the book shows you what these frameworks look like when they collide with real life.</p>

                    <p>When trauma begins at birth, it rewires the nervous system for constant threat detection. What looks like anxiety or overreaction is early wiring doing its job.</p>
