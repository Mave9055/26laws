            <h2>The Glass Box: Day One</h2>
            <p>I was born three months early on September 12, 1982 - three pounds, four ounces - and spent my first thirty days wired to machines in a glass incubator. In 1982, they didn't let parents touch premature babies. For a full month, I had no human contact. Just plastic walls, fluorescent lights, the mechanical hum of machines, and the sharp cry of alarms.</p>
            
            <p>A few days after birth, my systems started shutting down and a priest was called to administer Last Rites. Then my vitals stabilized. I decided to stay.</p>
            
            <p>But those thirty days carved a blueprint into my nervous system before my brain had words for it. Scientists now know that Very Low Birth Weight infants who spend time in NICUs can develop wiring for hypervigilance, insecure attachment, sensory sensitivity, and emotional intensity. My first world wasn't warmth and heartbeats - it was distance and danger. I learned that connection is inconsistent, that safety is found in stillness and isolation, and that I was somehow flawed in a way that required separation.</p>
            
            <p>This is what I call the "Glass Box Blueprint." It's not a metaphor - it's the literal architecture of my nervous system, the source code for how I would interpret every storm that followed.</p>

            <h2>The Storm Arrives</h2>
            <p>By age five, the external storm arrived. I witnessed severe domestic violence in my home. That freeze response wasn't just fear - it was my body defaulting to the only survival strategy it knew from the incubator: become still, become silent, disappear. The five-year-old hiding under that blanket and the newborn sealed in that glass box were using the exact same defense mechanism.</p>
            
            <p>Around age ten, I started experiencing sleep paralysis - waking frozen, unable to move or scream, a suffocating presence on my chest. Years later, this morphed into night screams during sleep apnea events. My body, trained to expect mortal danger, interpreted the lack of oxygen not as a physiological event but as an attack. The boy given Last Rites in an incubator was still fighting for breath in the dark decades later.</p>

            <h2>The Chemical Incubator</h2>
            <p>I started drinking at four years old. By sixteen, I was using alcohol to manage the constant anxiety, the buzzing under my skin that never stopped. At seventeen, after my cousin died, I discovered opiates. They didn't just numb the grief - they recreated something my body recognized as safety.</p>
            
            <p>That chemical numbness, that insulated silence, the complete absence of sensory overload - it was the closest I could get to the muted environment of the NICU. It was a "chemical incubator." I was addicted to opiates for seventeen years, and later to meth, always chasing that sensation of being sealed off from a world that felt unbearably loud and threatening.</p>

            <h2>What I Didn't Know</h2>
            <p>What I didn't know then - what I wouldn't understand for another twenty years - was that I had Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. My lifelong fear, my emotional chaos, my desperate need for connection mixed with my terror of abandonment - these weren't character flaws or moral failures. They were trauma responses. My nervous system was doing exactly what it had been trained to do since birth: protect me from danger by any means necessary, even if those means destroyed my relationships.</p>
            
            <p>I lost my marriage. I lost custody of my four children. I lost jobs, homes, and years to addiction. I hurt people I loved. Not because I was evil or weak, but because I was operating with a nervous system that had been programmed for survival in isolation, not connection.</p>

            <h2>I Am Not a Clinician</h2>
            <p>I am not a therapist. I am not a doctor. I don't have letters after my name.</p>
            
            <p>I'm a forty-three-year-old survivor who spent two decades trying to understand why I kept destroying everything I touched. I'm someone who read the research, connected the dots between neuroscience and lived experience, and learned to translate clinical language into something a person in crisis can actually use at 3 AM when their world is burning down.</p>
            
            <p>This website exists because the mental health system failed me repeatedly. Therapists who couldn't hear past their own frameworks. Treatment programs that punished trauma responses as moral failures. A diagnostic system that kept treating symptoms while ignoring the blueprint underneath.</p>

            <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
            <p>So I built my own framework. <strong>The 26 Laws</strong> aren't therapy - they're a survival manual written by someone who learned to read his own source code and rewrite it line by line. They're survivor-to-survivor education, translating complex trauma research into language that makes sense when you're in the middle of the storm.</p>
            
            <p>I'm not here to save you. I'm here to show you the map I drew while I was lost, so maybe your path out is a little clearer than mine was.</p>
            
            <p>If you're reading this, you're probably looking for answers the system couldn't give you. Welcome. Let's get to work.</p>

            <h2>Use What Helps. Ignore What Doesn't.</h2>
            <p>I built this so survivors can understand the <em>why</em> without the nonsense. You don't need my permission to take what works and leave the rest.</p>
