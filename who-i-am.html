            <h2>Not a Therapist. Not a Doctor. Not a Clinician.</h2>
            <p>I am not a licensed therapist, psychologist, psychiatrist, or medical professional. I have no clinical training and no letters after my name.</p>
            <p>This framework represents peer education—survivor-to-survivor knowledge transfer grounded in clinical research, lived experience, and years of studying trauma literature. This is not therapy. This is not medical advice. This is not a treatment protocol.</p>
            <p>This is a map built by someone who walked the terrain. If you need clinical treatment, seek clinical treatment. This work exists to help you understand what you're experiencing and why standard approaches may not be working—not to replace professional care.</p>

            <h2>Who I Actually Am</h2>
            <p>I'm a 43-year-old Arkansan who spent most of his life surviving things I didn't have names for—and then spent the rest figuring out what the hell actually happened to me.</p>

            <h2>Roots & Early Wiring</h2>
            <p>Fourth-generation Arkansas. My roots go deeper than the trauma, and trust me—that's saying something. I started life in a glass box: thirty days in a NICU incubator at three pounds, four ounces. Preverbal trauma was part of my wiring before I even had a word for it.</p>
            <p>What followed wasn't a single event; it was a cascade—the slow, normal kind of chaos that turns a kid into someone built for emergencies, not for peace.</p>

            <h2>What I've Done</h2>
            <p>I've been working since I was 14. Washing dishes under the table for $2/hour—I'd ride the school bus there and work evenings. Then the county surveyor. Roofing homes. Mowing yards. Painting decks and houses. Sweeping floors in a mechanic shop, learning about cars. Anything I could find.</p>
            
            <p>I worked to outrun my mind. The faster I moved, the slower it got. But the second I clocked out, it was beer and weed—whatever dulled the noise.</p>
            
            <p>Twenty years in food service after that. Every station, every shift. Cook, manager, weekend lead. I ran kitchens at truck stops, steakhouses, rental properties. Unloaded trucks, rotated stock, managed teams of 10+, kept health inspectors at zero violations. Twenty-three years doing property maintenance—preparing units, managing upkeep, handling whatever broke.</p>
            
            <p>The kind of work where you learn to troubleshoot on the fly because nobody's coming to save you.</p>

            <h2>I Write & I Research</h2>
            <p>I'm a songwriter—24+ originals across outlaw country, gospel, and southern rock. That's where trauma gets a language.</p>
            <p>I'm a genealogical researcher because trauma doesn't start with you. Understanding the cracks means understanding the blueprint. I've traced my family back through Civil War-era Arkansas, documenting how violence and survival echoed through generations before reaching me.</p>

                <p>The frameworks on this site come from years of research and the five complete rewrites of my memoir, <strong><em>From the Storm to the Fire: 26 Laws of Survival</em></strong>. Each rewrite was a new attempt to map the wreckage with clinical accuracy.</p>
                
                <p>I've refined the trauma architecture five times, integrating new science and deeper personal understanding. What you see here—The Glass Box, Rewiring the Blueprint, the 26 Laws—are the concepts that <strong>survived every single rewrite</strong>. They are battle-tested against my own experience so you don't have to start from scratch.</p>

            <h2>The Legal System</h2>
            <p>I've been through the legal system—missed court dates, failure-to-appear charges, public defenders, hearings I didn't make because I was in the hospital with blood sugar high enough to kill someone.</p>
            <p>I've lived the consequences of a trauma-wired nervous system colliding with institutions that don't understand it and don't care to. That doesn't mean you're broken. It means the system wasn't built for someone with your wiring.</p>

            <p>I lost custody of my kids. I lost my mother. I stopped managing my health. I did the things trauma-wired people do to survive—and paid the price. I'm not here to be pitied. I'm here to be useful.</p>

            <p>I turned wreckage into frameworks. I read the clinical papers, then tested the ideas while living the street-level consequences. I learned the maps so I could stop walking blind.</p>
            <p>This site exists because I needed it—and because I don't want the next survivor feeling around in the dark for answers that should've been easy to find.</p>
