        <h2>Finding Professional Help</h2>

        <h3>What to Look For in a Trauma Therapist</h3>

        <p>The most important thing is feeling like you can learn to trust your therapist. Trust your gut.</p>

        <p>A good trauma therapist will:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li>Have understanding of trauma and CPTSD specifically</li>
            <li>Be trained in trauma modalities (EMDR, CBT, DBT, etc.)</li>
            <li>Hold firm boundaries</li>
            <li>Engage in self-care outside their work</li>
            <li>Hold hope for healing</li>
            <li>Be strength-based and flexible to adapt treatment to your needs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key Areas of Expertise to Seek</h3>

        <ul class="symptom-list">
            <li><strong>Complex Trauma</strong> Specific experience with CPTSD, not just PTSD</li>

            <li><strong>Developmental Trauma</strong> Knowledge of how childhood trauma impacts adult functioning</li>

        <p>Online support can be valuable, but it's important to maintain boundaries and be aware that not all advice will be healthy or applicable to your situation.</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h4>A Note on Online Communities</h4>
            <p>Online support spaces can be helpful, but they can also become echo chambers or inadvertently reinforce unhealthy patterns. They're not substitutes for professional care. If you notice a community is making you feel worse, it's okay to step back.</p>

        <h2>About This Site</h2>

        <p>The Wounded Blueprint is a peer education platform created to provide clear, direct information about Complex PTSD without the clinical distance or toxic positivity that dominates most trauma resources.</p>

        <p>The frameworks and materials here come from years of lived experience, research, and the process of making sense of my own trauma architecture. I share them because understanding the blueprint was the first critical step in my own healing.</p>

        <p>If these materials help you map your own wreckage, that's what they're for.</p>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>

        <p>This is a living project. If you have suggestions for additional resources, find errors, or want to share how these frameworks have (or haven't) been useful, feedback is welcome.</p>

        <p>This site exists to serve survivors—if it's not doing that effectively, I want to know.</p>
