                <h3>Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD)</h3>
                <div class="definition-content">
                    <p><strong>Clinical Definition:</strong> A diagnostic category for a trauma disorder following prolonged, repeated, or cumulative trauma where the victim has little to no chance of escape.</p>
                    <p><strong>Peer Education / The Blueprint:</strong> A survival architecture. It's what happens when your nervous system is forced to adapt to a sustained state of terror, turning off your ability to trust, feel safe, or regulate emotion. You're not broken—your survival wiring is stuck in the 'on' position.</p>
                    <p class="takeaway"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> CPTSD is a functional description of your survival state, not a permanent diagnosis of your worth.</p>
                </div>

            <div class="term-card" id="dysregulation">
                <h3>Emotional Dysregulation</h3>
                <div class="definition-content">
                    <p><strong>Clinical Definition:</strong> The inability to modulate the intensity and duration of emotional responses, often resulting in sudden, disproportionate, or prolonged mood states (e.g., explosive anger or deep despair).</p>
                    <p><strong>Peer Education / The Blueprint:</strong> A system failure. When the nervous system is chronically tuned to high-alert (hypervigilance), the brain's emotional brake pedal (prefrontal cortex) never develops properly. Your emotions are not "too much"; your regulatory system is under-resourced and easily overwhelmed.</p>
                    <p class="takeaway"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Healing isn't about control; it's about building emotional resilience through nervous system repair.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="term-card" id="hypervigilance">
                <h3>Hypervigilance</h3>
                <div class="definition-content">
                    <p><strong>Clinical Definition:</strong> An enhanced state of sensory sensitivity accompanied by an exaggerated intensity of behaviors whose purpose is to detect threat. It is a constant, exhausting feeling of being on guard.</p>
                    <p><strong>Peer Education / The Blueprint:</strong> A necessary survival program. You were constantly scanning your environment for threats because danger was real and pervasive. This mechanism saved your life, but it has outlived its usefulness. Your task is to convince your body the threat is over.</p>
                    <p class="takeaway"><strong>Takeaway:</strong> You can't talk yourself out of hypervigilance; you have to teach your body safety.</p>
